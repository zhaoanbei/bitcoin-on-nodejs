But if you think of its implication: &nbsp;&quot;cryptocurrency may not be money,&quot; you may find it interesting. In fact, many of my friends, including myself, held the latter opinion at the very beginning, and it took me some time to reach this conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The law of inertia exists not only in the material world, but also in the cognitive world. The greater our experience is, the greater the resistance to understanding new things especially towards brandy-new stuffs without eye-catching name and novel technology. It could be quite &nbsp; confusing to imagine that technology is disruptive innovation and will change the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I am trying to write a simple, entry-level article for those who have not been exposed to cryptocurrencies to bridge human thinking and cryptocurrencies. If you get a little excited and want to keep exploring, this article is a success.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This article covers some basic concepts including: what is cryptocurrency? How is it different from digital coins that people use every day? What are the advantages? Why are they so popular? Basically, it is about the most basic understanding I have as a programmer.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.lrvafp7jdkb"><span class="c8">The simplest history of cryptocurrency</span></h3><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cryptocurrency is a kind of digital currency. Before bitcoin appeared, &quot;digital currency&quot;, &quot;virtual currency&quot;, &quot;electronic money&quot; already emerged, especially &quot;virtual currency&quot;, which refers to &nbsp;digitization or virtualization of &ldquo;real&rdquo;, &ldquo;legal&rdquo; currency, such as the US dollar and RMB, through online banking, alipay, etc, enabling people to pay without money.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Later, on the game platform, the concept of game currency was first put forward. Players used game currency to buy equipments. Then, websites launched various currencies to attract users. The most intuitive interpretation of those game currency, is actually &quot;token money.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In recent years, bitcoin, a real digital currency that can be called money, came out. However, people are reluctant to distinguish it from other forms of digital coins. On the one hand, the law of inertia still exists: people around the world have rich experience in using digital currency, why is it different?</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the other hand, the resistance of acceptance is huge: to understand cryptocurrency, people need to know about P2P network, encryption decryption, and maybe database technology, neither of which is obtained by common people.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if all of these technologies are available, realizing all functions and features and make it similar to a real currency is no easy. In people&#39;s thinking, the &quot;digital currency&quot; is a &ldquo;token&rdquo; rather than a currency, so the statement &quot;Cryptocurrency is currency&quot; could be confusing indeed.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.tkypn8hxk7qb"><span class="c8">What is cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&quot;Cryptocurrency&quot; can be interpreted as an encrypted electronic money (or digital currency), a typical example is the bitcoin. So let&#39;s use bitcoin to define cryptocurrency:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12">Cryptocurrency is a kind of cryptographic electronic currency based on point-to-point network (P2P network), without issuing institutions and with a fixed total amount.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Notes:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(1) P2P network: this is not a new concept. The first Bit download we used was based on P2P network, which is supported by many download tools. Its advantage is &quot;decentralization&quot;, that is, there is no central server, the files downloaded are all on the user&#39;s own computer, and the download speed is faster;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(2) Without issuing institutions: that is to say, it is not controlled by certain company, bank or state. This requires very complex mechanisms and rules in programming.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(3) Fixed total amount: this is a strategy to ensure the value of cryptocurrency. As an old saying goes: &quot;Scarcity equals to preciousness&quot;, anything without limit will lose its attraction. This is different from online community credits.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(4) Encryption: encryption mentioned here is not access control such as user name or password, but trading and transmission encryption. Cryptology is complex in its own right, but it&#39;s not complicated to use.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(5) Electronic currency: Encrypted currency is money. Like legal currency, it can be freely traded. So what about community credits? Are they currency? The answer is no, which will be explained in detail below.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.m6c2bqky70e3"><span class="c10">Cryptocurrency is currency</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Crypto-currency is currency, which is a bizarre conclusion that is close to &quot;nonsense,&quot; and it&#39;s much easier to understand when we understand the history and concept definitions above. But if you&#39;re not a technologist and have trouble to understand it, please compare it with legal currency and find some common ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(1) Quantitative: the legal currency is usually tied to the gold behind it or the so-called GDP, which is relatively fixed (We do not discuss excess issuance here). Cryptocurrency can be counted as an absolute fixed amount, or a small amount of additional issuance (which can make up for some lost currency, etc.) to prevent inflation.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there is no fixed amount of digital coins provided by some websites. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(2) Encryption: legal currency has physical security of highest level of technology and can be verified through the counterfeit detector. Encryption technology of cryptocurrency is the equivalent of anti-counterfeiting technology, and every transaction will be strictly encryped. Cracking this encryption is theoretically possible, but not feasible financially, so it is even more difficult to counterfeit cryptocurrency. At the same time, the verification mechanism of Cryptocurrency is much simpler, quicker and more accurate than legal currency.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the digital currency of some individual websites is only a series of numbers, and the administrator can modify and freeze information, and their encryption is permission control when the user logs in.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(3) Transaction: legal currency, also known as currency or general equivalent, can be exchanged with any merchant and bought anything, which is the most basic attribute of currency. The same is true for encrypted money, which you can pay to any party, and the encrypted money will arrive safely without fear of being hijacked, hacked, or reduced.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, this is not true for digital currency of some websites: they have no such function at all, and can only be traded within the website. Some stores can trade digital currency between many websites, but those websites belong to the same owner. Of course, a website can trade with other websites if it has an agreement with a third party to set the value of its digital currency, but the essence of this transaction is still legal currency. No one is likely to sign this agreement, at least not me, because there is no oversight, no control, no guarantee of absolute trust.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.9feliiksn12u"><span class="c8">Is cryptocurrency reliable?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From discussion above, we understand how cryptocurrency works, but we may still cast doubt on the usage of cryptocurrency. Is it reliable? This is the first question that many people ask. The answer is yes, of course, but there are many techniques and theories involved to explain why. Fortunately, these technologies and theories are mature technologies. If you think they&#39;re reliable, the following explanation is easy to understand. Otherwise, it&#39;s hard to convince yourself that crypto-currencies are more reliable than the digital ones of some websites.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(1) Decentralization</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It is easier to start with &quot;centralization&quot;. Currently, all the major websites we visit are centralized, since we must have one or more servers to sort out the content we browse. If the server breaks down, no one will have access to either websites. In other words, centralization means that everything is controlled by an organization or company.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Decentralization, on the other hand, is based on P2P network, without any machine as the centralized server: every computer in the network is equal, and if anyone dropped down, the network will still continue. If everyone trusts the network, it will last forever, just like bitcoin networks. Specifically, please refer to &quot;a sophisticated p2p network implementation&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is an cryptocurrency trading channel.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Network foundation, barrier-free transaction&hellip; Anytime, anywhere, as long as you can access the Internet, you can get involved in this trading network and pay cryptocurrency to any part of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(2) Encryption and decryption</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We have free routes, but are they safe? Is there any robber? What if we get hijacked or cracked? What&#39;s more, if we&#39;re on our way through private location (personal or organizational computers), there may be a hacker waiting to strike.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This requires advanced encryption and decryption technology. Fortunately, encryption and decryption technology have been &nbsp;used in the Internet communities for years, safe and sound. Theoretically, it is meaningless to decrypt and crack a single node and difficult to decrypt all nodes. Moreover, the number of P2P network node is huge, so the security level of cryptocurrency should be the highest for now.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the foundation of cryptocurrency. With this tech, we can safely pay out the cryptocurrency without fear of losing or getting stolen, and the buyer can have the basic motivation to pay for transactions. For encryption and decryption technology, please refer to &quot;Encryption and decryption technology in node.js&quot; and &quot;three graphs to give you a comprehensive grasp of encryption and decryption technology&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(3) Blockchain</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We can make the payment safely, but another concern comes. How can we guarantee that the seller has received it or not? What if the seller doesn&#39;t get paid? Who will guarantee this sense of trust?</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The answer is blockchain. This is the originally created by cryptocurrency, but the database technology behind is a rather simple. The essence of blockchain is transaction data stored in a database, and its structure is that each record will record the hash value of previous record, so that we can trace back to the first block.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">More importantly, the database, which is distributed across P2P networks, holds a copy of each node, and everyone can access it publicly and view the transaction records. In other words, not only can both parties see the transaction result, but the entire network can see it. It is open, transparent and traceable, so you have to believe it.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is the credit guarantee of crypto.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;No economic action can be achieved without trust. This originality of Crypto opens a door for public, transparent and traceable credit system, and provide infinite possibilities for companies, organizations and individuals. Later, I will continue to share the code of the blockchain of Yishu, the mysterious blockchain (to be completed).</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(4) Consensus mechanism</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Is it enough to have security and credibility? Another problem is, since there are so many nodes in the same database, how can we decide which node should be allowed to &ldquo;write&rdquo;? Moreover, crypto has fixed amount of total currency, what if a node misbehave itself and increase the total amount? </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The solution is &quot;consensus mechanism&quot;, also an algorithms mechanisms, including work proof mechanism (POW), equity system (POS), certificate of authorization equity mechanism (DPOS) etc, which is like principle of collective decisions and rules in a discussion. This is where crypto needs to be encoded, and it is also the difficulty of crypto development.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In particular, the DPOS mechanism is basically the shareholder voting mechanism of a joint-stock company, which is the algorithm mechanism used by Yishu. Later, I will continue to share articles, including Yishu implementation of DPOS mechanism (to be completed).</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is the operation rule of cryptocurrency.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It is the place where the previous common technologies are integrated and innovated. Without understanding this part, it is impossible to talk about cryptocurrency development.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finally, the above techniques are interdependent and mutual supported through consensus mechanism as a whole, and this ensures the absolute safety of payments and trade without issuing institutions.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.3bdt03i3hjjz"><span class="c8">Conclusion</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Imagine, what a highly autonomous network would bring us(future trend)? What can we do with cryptocurrency (applications)? If you invest or start a business in this industry, what should you pay attention to (risk and methods)? Read the following passage: interests, the common goal of devil and angel. For answers.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
